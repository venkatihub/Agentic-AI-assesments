### 2. **To what extent do dominant social science paradigms reflect and perpetuate existing power structures, and what alternative theoretical frameworks can offer more equitable and inclusive understandings of social phenomena?** (This addresses the critical perspective on the discipline's own role in shaping social realities.)
**6.2 Paradigms, theories, and how they shape a researcher's approach**

A third paradigm is the **critical** paradigm. At its core, the critical paradigm is focused on power, inequality, and social change. Although some rather diverse perspectives are included here, the critical paradigm generally includes ideas developed by early social theorists, such as Max Horkheimer (Calhoun, Gerteis, Moody, Pfaff, & Virk, 2007), [[4]](#footnote-92-4 "Calhoun, C., Gerteis, J., Moody, J., Pfaff, S., & Virk, I. (Eds.). (2007). Classical sociological theory (2nd ed.). Malden, MA: [...] | Critical | Power, inequality, and social change | Social science can never be truly value-free and should be conducted with the express goal of social change in mind. |
| Postmodernism | Inherent problems with previous paradigms. | Truth is always bound within historical and cultural context. There are no universally true explanations. | [...] In Chapter 1, we discussed the various ways that we know what we know. Paradigms are a way of framing what we know, what we can know, and how we can know it. In social science, there are several predominant paradigms, each with its own unique ontological and epistemological perspective. Recall that ontology is the study of what is real, and epistemology is the study of how we come to know what is real. Let’s look at four of the most common social scientific paradigms that might guide you as you

**The impact of artificial intelligence on human society and bioethics**

1.   A huge social change that disrupts the way we live in the human community will occur. Humankind has to be industrious to make their living, but with the service of AI, we can just program the machine to do a thing for us without even lifting a tool. Human closeness will be gradually diminishing as AI will replace the need for people to meet face to face for idea exchange. AI will stand in between people as the personal gathering will no longer be needed for communication [...] T HE IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON HUMAN SOCIETY

### 6. **How can social scientists effectively engage with diverse communities and marginalized populations to ensure research is ethically conducted, relevant, and ultimately benefits those most affected by the issues under investigation?** (This underscores the ethical and practical importance of community engagement in research.)
**4. Practices and Strategies for Ethically Engaging with Communities ...**

Crucially, researchers must establish effective partnerships with communities to ensure that research is conducted ethically. These partnerships should consider a community’s values, needs, and knowledge. Involving community members in every stage of the research process enhances the relevance and potential impact of the research because community members often have valuable knowledge and understanding of local realities [*Israel et al.*, 2013].  Trust and mutual benefit should be fostered. But [...] involves setting clear mutual goals, identifying stakeholders, assessing community needs, and maintaining ongoing involvement to sustain trust and ensure the success of the research. [...] includes identifying stakeholders. Identifying initial key stakeholders can help a researcher incorporate community participants, local organizations, government agencies, and other pertinent parties, and this type of relationship building is essential to establishing **reciprocity** with a community. Although researchers may have input (and initially need to choose someone to contact), the community should largely identify their own stakeholders. Collaboratively mapping out these stakeholders

**Engaging Underrepresented Communities in Research - ELSIhub**

**Katherine McDonald & Maya Sabatello**: Community-engaged research has shown to be a useful process for building trust between researchers and underrepresented populations. Such engagement builds on bi-directional relationships, whereby both the researchers and community members are viewed as experts and equal partners throughout the research cycle—through conception, implementation, dissemination of results, and knowledge translation. The ongoing dialogue between these stakeholders can shed [...] **Leidymee Medina De Jesús**: It is important to create a direct alliance between researchers and communities. To achieve this, there must be transparent, informative, and genuine communication from the beginning. It is vital that the community feel part of the research and can understand how essential their contribution and participation in it is. Similarly, researchers must create a respectful environment where the community feels safe and comfortable when expressing themselves and the [...] **Ivelisse Rivera**: Don’t be afraid to approach these communities. Take your time to learn from them and about them. Make sure you focus on research that will benefit them and add community leaders and research professionals into your team. Working with direct input from your target population makes a difference.

**Opinion: Community engagement is an ethical imperative**

“To be efficient in getting to the heart of the matter in life, know what matters to the heart.” This quote by writer and storyteller, Cindy Yantis, has been the mantra that frames my community-engaged research. Quite simply, how can social and behavioral scientists opine about various phenomena and results of their research without first understanding if, how, and why that issue is important to the people experiencing it? How else can researchers know these things at the core of a research [...] participation. At its highest level, community engagement is characterized by collaboratively working toward shared goals and interests, and there is mutual benefit in the collaborative. At its core, community engagement is built on authentic partnerships consisting of mutual respect and active, inclusive participation. Power is shared, and equity among all players—researcher, community mobilizer, service providers, and other community members—is prioritized. Everyone has something important to [...] Building meaningful community engagement increases the likelihood of long-term benefits in the community. It can ensure that disparities and inequalities are not inadvertently replicated or reinforced.
