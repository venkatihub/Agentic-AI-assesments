Here's a professional `README.md` file for your **Agentic AI Content Refinement** app that simulates a conversation between a Content Creator and a Content Critic:

# 🤖 Agentic AI Content Refinement

An intelligent multi-agent simulation using **Gemini 1.5 Flash**, **LangChain**, and **AutoGen**, where a **Content Creator AI** drafts technical content and a **Content Critic AI** reviews and refines it iteratively — mimicking an editorial feedback loop.

Ideal for generating and improving **markdown-based technical content** on topics like AI, ML, NLP, or emerging tech.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🧠 **Agent Collaboration**: Simulated conversation between Creator and Critic agents.
* ✍️ **Markdown Output**: Creator produces content in clean markdown format.
* 🧪 **Critique Feedback**: Critic evaluates for clarity, accuracy, and depth.
* 🔁 **Multi-turn Iteration**: Number of conversation rounds (3–5) configurable via UI.
* 🧵 **Conversation Trace**: View all turns with full content and feedback.
* 🚫 **Autonomous Flow**: No human input required during simulation.

## 🔧 Key Components

### GeminiAgent Class

Custom wrapper to make LangChain models deepcopy-compatible inside AutoGen agents.

### Creator Agent

```python
AssistantAgent(
    name="Creator",
    system_message="Draft and revise markdown content...",
    ...
)
```

Creates original and revised markdown content based on feedback.

### Critic Agent

```python
AssistantAgent(
    name="Critic",
    system_message="Evaluate technical accuracy, clarity, and structure...",
    ...
)
```

Reviews content, provides specific improvement suggestions.

## 💬 Sample Turn Output

### Turn 1: Creator

> Drafts original content about *Agentic AI*, with structured sections like:
>
> * Key Concepts
> * Technical Foundations
> * Real-world Applications
> * Future Implications

### Turn 2: Critic

> Identifies good structure but suggests deeper examples and clearer definitions.

### Turn 3: Creator

> Revises content based on feedback and improves clarity.
